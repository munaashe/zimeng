## Tech Stack Used


## Next.js

- Server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO.
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loading.
- API routes for building serverless functions.
- File-based routing for easy navigation setup.
- Rich ecosystem and active community support.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that brings type safety and improved developer experience to the project. Some of the reasons for using TypeScript in this project include:

- Early detection of errors and type-related issues.
- Improved code maintainability and readability.
- Enhanced autocompletion and IntelliSense.
- Better refactoring capabilities.
- Seamless integration with popular tools and libraries.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of highly customizable and low-level utility classes. Some of the reasons for using Tailwind CSS in this project include:

- Rapid prototyping and development with pre-defined utility classes.
- Easy customization and theming options.
- Responsive design capabilities out of the box.
- Efficient and optimized CSS output.
- Large community and extensive documentation.


### Language Switching with Next-Intl

Next-Intl is a localization library for Next.js applications that provides a seamless way to handle internationalization and language switching. Here are the justifications for using Next-Intl in this project:

- **Multi-language Support**: Next-Intl allows for easy management of multiple languages within the application. It provides a convenient way to define translations and switch between different language versions of the content.

- **Simplified Localization**: Next-Intl simplifies the process of localizing the application by providing a straightforward API for defining and accessing translations. It abstracts away the complexities of manually managing language files and provides a centralized place for managing translations.

- **Dynamic Language Switching**: Next-Intl enables dynamic language switching without requiring a full page reload. This means that users can switch between languages on the fly, and the content will update instantly without losing the current state or context of the application.

- **Pluralization and Formatting**: Next-Intl handles complex language features such as pluralization and formatting of numbers, dates, and currencies. It ensures that the application can display localized content correctly based on the user's language preferences.

- **SEO-friendly**: Next-Intl ensures that the localized content is properly indexed by search engines. It generates separate URLs for each language version of the page, allowing search engines to crawl and index the content specific to each language.

- **Flexible and Scalable**: Next-Intl provides a flexible architecture that allows for easy integration with other localization tools and libraries. It can be extended and customized to meet the specific requirements of the project, making it suitable for both small and large-scale applications.


### GraphQL

- **Declarative Data Fetching**: GraphQL enables precise and efficient data fetching by allowing you to specify exactly the data your application needs. With tools like Apollo Client, fetching, caching, and managing data from GraphQL APIs becomes more intuitive and streamlined, as you can query deeply nested data in a single request without multiple endpoints.

- **Automatic Cache Management and Normalization**: Apollo Client, one of the most popular libraries for GraphQL, automatically manages and normalizes the cache. It provides fine-grained control over caching strategies and lets you define how and when to refetch data, preventing unnecessary network requests and improving performance.

- **Real-time Data and Optimistic UI**: GraphQL supports real-time data with subscriptions, often used with WebSockets. Libraries like Apollo Client and Relay handle subscriptions seamlessly, allowing you to keep data updated without manual polling. Optimistic updates let you temporarily update the UI immediately upon a mutation, offering a smooth, low-latency experience while the actual update completes on the server.

- **Pagination and Infinite Scrolling**: GraphQL is well-suited for implementing pagination and infinite scrolling through cursor-based pagination or offset-based pagination. GraphQL clients provide support for managing these patterns, making it easier to load more data incrementally as users scroll. For example, Apollo Client’s fetchMore function and Relay’s pagination container offer straightforward solutions for paginated data fetching.
